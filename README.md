The AI will improve his minions' stats every level to make the game challenging. The player can move the camera to see any side of the map, but he can only see the enemies in skouted places.
Each level has a different pathfinding algorithm for the minions.

## Data Structures
* Node:
Data structure that saves an element into a greater data structure which will reference a starting node and the nodes will reference the next node.
* List:
The list is a linear collection of nodes.
* Matrix:
The matrix is a two dimensions data structure that save a list of lists.
## Algorithms
### Pathfinding:
* A* Search:
The A* Search algorithm takes a starting node from the graph and generate a tree with the paths it can take until the algorithm finds the target node, then the tree gives the path that reach the target.
* Prim:
* Dijkstra:
* Kruskal:
